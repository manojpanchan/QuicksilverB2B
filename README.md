# QuicksilverB2B
Installation
------------

1.  Configure Visual Studio to add this package source: http://nuget.episerver.com/feed/packages.svc/. This allows missing packages to be downloaded, when the solution is built.
2.  Open solution and build to download nuget package dependencies.
3.  Search the solution for "ChangeThis" and review/update as described.
4.  Run Setup\SetupDatabases.cmd to create the databases *. In the unlucky event of errors please check the logs.  
5.  Start the site (Debug-Start from Visual studio) and browse to http://localhost:50244 to finish installation. Login with admin@example.com/store.

*By default SetupDatabases.cmd use the default SQL Server instance. Change this line `set sql=sqlcmd -S . -E` by replacing `.` with the instance name to use different instance.

Note: SQL scripts are executed using Windows authentication so make sure your user has sufficient permissions.
